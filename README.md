# Simon game with Pro Mini

Fun little project that has grown quite more than expected, at least on the
hardware side.

There will be a proper log for this later, with schematics etc. 
(update, 3 months later: or maybe not)

For now, you can have a peek and thank heavens you don't have to understand
any of it xD
